# About me  
My name is Abdulqadir Ahmad (You can call me Abdul or Abuahmad). I like writing codes, [Python](https://python.org) and [neovim](https://neovim.io) are like home to me now. I have wrote Python, C, Lua, js and even BrainFuck :). I like reading books, Especially historical fiction and supernatural + action ones. I hate in-accessible softwares. I like listening to podcasts. I talk too much, it sometimes get me into trouble.
