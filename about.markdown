# About me  
My name is Abdulqadir Ahmad (You can call me Abdul or Ahmad). I write codes. Python and vim are like home to me now. I have wrote Python, C, Lua, js and even BrainFuck :). I like reading books. Especially historical fiction and supernatural + action ones. I hate in-accessible softwares.
