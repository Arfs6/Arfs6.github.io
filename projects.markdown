# Projects  
---

This page contains some projects I've worked on and the ones I am currently working on.  
## [TWBLUE](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue)  
TW Blue is an open source free client for [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) with a focus on accessibility. It uses native UI and works on Windows. It could work on other platforms, but I don't think it is properly tested for that. It uses python and WX Python as the GUI library.  
This is the first open source project I have ever contributed to and I still contribute to.  

## [Comodoro](https://github.com/arfs6/comodoro)  
A cross platform pomodoro app that works on command line and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI).I have stopped working on it because I have realised there are a lot of pomodoro apps. I am currently using yapa (Yet Another Pomodoro App). So, instead of spending my time building it, I decided to stop maintaining it and move to other projects.
