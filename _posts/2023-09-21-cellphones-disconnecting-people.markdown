title: Are Cellphones Connecting or Disconnecting People

It is sad how people are in the same place but there minds are somewhere else. That is what cellphones have done to us. It disconnects you with people arround you.  

I used to think it was social media that does that. Now, I have realised, it is the phone itself. Social media is just part of the problem.
