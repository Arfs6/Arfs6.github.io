The following passage was written by a [friend](https://twitter.com/kpakpando1) of mine. It is so captivating. I like it! If you also like it, please reach out to him on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kpakpando1) and tell him!  
Enjoy!  
_First it was cache. And then decorate. And now parameterize, memoize, and mock!!!_  
_Python never ceases to amaze!_  
_So what, if any, do these have in common, besides being wrapped together in a module? A lot!_  
_Memoization is a use case for caching, i.e., memoization is caching when the cached thing is the result of a function call; in that case, the function being cached has to be designed to maintain the cache. And if the function is not natively able to memoize, it's easy - you decorate it! Remember, decoration is that magic that makes a function appear to do more than what it is born to do, without it having to be born again.ðŸ˜€ Just memoize it! By decorating it!_  
_And after that, you can even mock it. Yes, thatâ€™s right - pretend to be the function when you are a pure fake! And itâ€™s easy to do that too - just import Mock from unittest.mock and create a mock object and make it fake to return anything you wish! Or, if you are enjoying the pun, try MagicMock. Same stuff, with more Python magic sprinkled on it.ðŸ˜€_  
_And oh, I almost forgot: while youâ€™re at it, there is more fun - you can make multiple tests more cool - just parameterize it. That is, use one test with parameters to do several others at once, like killing several birds with one stone._  
_See? Itâ€™s easy when you think about it!_  
_No cacheðŸ˜€_
