excerpt: The person transfered everything in his bank
---
One of my friend was recently robbed by some one close to him. This post isn't meant to critisize him, but to learn from the incident. Let's say his name is Bryan.  

## Trust

Bryan is a student at a university, he lives in the school hostel. His room mates often use his phone for many reasons. We blind people depend on sighted people for somethings like describing images and a lot more. So, his room mates knew how to remove [talk back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) from his phone and use it. Further more, Bryan has gave them his debit card to get cash for him.  

## The act

A new semester began and Bryan was about to pay for his school fees and hostel. The money was sent to his account. I can't remember how exactly, but someone got access to his phone, and bought NGN 10,000 airtime to a number and transfered all his money to an account. We're suspecting his room mates because it's not everybody that knows how to remove talk back from a phone. The bad actor was able to reset his bank app passcode, which I guess he doesn't know. We know that because of the OTP message that was sent to his phone. As for the transfer pin, it's the same with his debit card.

## Lessons

Let's share this into two - one for blind people and another for sighted people.

### For Blind People

I think the first thing to do is to increase the security of your phone. Like, my phone's screen is black and you can't turn off the screen reader when the phone is locked. This will make it extremely difficult for bad actors to take my phone and turn off the screen reader. Other things you can do is to have separate passwords for your things. A separate password for your phone, debit card, bank app, transfer pin. Of course this means having to remember all, but it is better than seeing your account cleared.

It has been a long time since I used my debit card to withdraw money. I usually transfer it to the POS guys. Know who you trust with vital info like debit card pin. Meanwhile, you shouldn't be over protective. People will not want to help you if you are always suspicious of them. Just, be wise.

### For Sighted People

I know someone would be like, why would someone rob a blind people. Well, there are good people and there are bad people. I have met awesome people and cruel people. That is just how live is. The lesson here is don't do what you wouldn't like it to be done to you. Do not steal someones money.

## Can you help?

If you can help Bryan with anything, please don't hesitate to send me a dm anywhere.
