My editor has always been growing with me since when I started programming.

It started up as something that just works, nothing more. I was learning it piece by piece, day by day.

After some coding, I added some linters to help me catch some basic errors. I was tired of meeting simple errors I could fix without too much thinking. EX missing a semi colon.

Next up, it's lsp for stuffs like go to definition and better errors than linters.

I then added complition for snippets (Very useful in html and latex) and for lsp suggestions.

I then added copilot for even better suggestions.

Now, I am thinking of adding debuggers. I want to be able to step through my code to see what is going on. Sometimes, logs doesn't provide all the critical info I need to debug a problem.

I have no idea what I'll add / remove after that.
