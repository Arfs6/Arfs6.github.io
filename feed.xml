<ul>
  <li>This one was when i was in secondary school (or high school).  I and my friends were going somewhere on foot, and they stopped to buy something. As usuall, my white cane was with one of them. Seeing that I know the road and I am already on a pavement (walkway), I decided to continue walking without a guide. A couple of steps later, I bumped into  someone. His first reaction was:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Are you blind?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I was like:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Yes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>After some convincing by my friends, he realised I was truly blind and the table turned on him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>This next one was very recent. I was in a hall with a couple of people, and someway, somehow my phone fell. And then boom someone goes <em>“Are you blind?”</em>. I just ignored the question and continued using my phone. Later the person came to realise, I was truly blind.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lesson">Lesson</h2>

<p>Try as much as possible not to ask such questions, especially to someone you don’t know. Blind people exist, and who knows, maybe the person is blind. It doesn’t border me that much, but I’m sure it is going to border some of the people that asked me.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdulqadir Ahmad</name></author><category term="blind" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get asked this question often.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">os</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">/home/arfs6</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">/proj</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># Expecting /home/arfs6/proj

<p>This was unexpected to me. I tried solving it by converting the second path to a relative path, and here is what i got:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">relpath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">/proj</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like python is been too smart here. Just do what I asked you, nothing more, nothing less!</p>

<p>At this point, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to resolve to string manipulation for paths.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdulqadir Ahmad</name></author><category term="python" /><category term="python," /><category term="os-module" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[>>> os.path.join('/home/arfs6', '/proj') # Expecting /home/arfs6/proj]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Did you know? ufw is a python script.</title><link href="https://arfs6.me/blog/python/2023/10/19/ufw-python.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Did you know? ufw is a python script." /><published>2023-10-19T19:33:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-19T19:33:00+00:00</updated><id>https://arfs6.me/blog/python/2023/10/19/ufw-python</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arfs6.me/blog/python/2023/10/19/ufw-python.html"><![CDATA[<p>Out of curiosity, I wanted to know what ufw (uncomplicated Firewall) was made up of. So, I looked for it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which ufw
/usr/sbin/ufw
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yours might be somewhere else. I then paid the directory a visit and checked what the file was made up of:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /usr/sbin
<span class="nv">$ </span>file ufw
ufw: Python script, ASCII text executable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I then opened it with vim, but since I can open it here, let me show you some part of it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">head </span>ufw
<span class="c">#! /usr/bin/python3</span>
<span class="c">#</span>

from ufw.util import error, warn, msg, _findpath, create_lock, release_lock

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> prints the first ten lines of the file, while the second command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> prints all the lines that contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> in it.</p>

<p>So, it turns out, ufw is “just” a python script bundled with a package that lives somewhere in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sys.path</code>.</p>

I had no idea where to keep my files or where some files are located. Fast forward, now I am comfortable in linux. I spend most of my time in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">wsl</a>. I am even writing this article in it.</p>

<p>In this post, I will walk you through the linux file system. You’ll know where to keep your file and where some key folders are located. But before we start, let’s go through some jargons.</p>

<h2 id="jargons">Jargons</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Directory: A directory is like a folder in windows. It holds other directories and files.</li>
  <li><em>/</em>: Linux uses a forward slash (<em>/</em>) to seperate directories and files. Windows uses a back slash (**).</li>
  <li>path: Specifies location of a file / directory in a filesystem. e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/root/.bashrc</code>. Remember: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> is used to seperate files and directories in linux. So, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/root/.bashrc</code> means the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> directory.</li>
  <li>File Permissions: This determines who can read, write or execute a file / directory.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="root-directory---">Root Directory - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code></h2>

<p>This is the main directory. it holds all other directories. Typically, in windows, a path to a file will start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c:</code>. Where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> is the drive letter. In linux, a path always starts with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>. Windows uses the drive letter to represent a storage device (like flash) or a partition. While on linux, all storage devices and partitions are in the root directory.</p>

<h2 id="home-directory---">Home Directory - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code></h2>

<p>This is usually where you find yourself when you login. If you’re login as the root user, that will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/root/</code>. If you’re login as another user, e.g. ubuntu, that will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/ubuntu/</code>. A user has read, write and execute permissions to all the files and folders in his home directory unless explicitly changed. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> is a special character that represents a users home directory. You can use it in paths.</p>

<p>This is where I keep my files. I have a folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> for documents, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repos</code> for git repos, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projects</code> for my projects and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alx</code> for <a href="https://alxswe.com">alx</a> related files.</p>

<h2 id="temporary-files-directory---tmp">Temporary files directory - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/tmp/</code></h2>

<p>This is a folder where you can keep temporary files. The operating system delete files that are not used for a while. So, don’t keep anything useful here. Some programs keeps there temporary files here. I keep some files I download here. e.g. A script for installing something. I often use it when I want a file temporarily. e.g. A small C program.</p>

<h2 id="executables-directory---bin">Executables Directory - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code></h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> directory is used for holding executables. There are several <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> directories. Some of the most important include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/</code>: Most apps you install using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> command and default programs like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> are here.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/bin/</code>: This bin directory is local to a user. My <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> executable is here.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-important-directories">Other important Directories</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/</code>: Some program store it’s log files here. Useful for debugging.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/</code>: System configuration files and other program configuration files are here. Don’t mess with files here unless you know what you’re doing.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/&lt;program name&gt;/</code>: Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;program name&gt;</code> is a program’s name; Holds user specific configuration for that program. e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/</code> for ssh and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.vim/</code> for vim.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/</code>: Config directory for some programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the information you have now, you can navigate arround the linux file system with ease. With time, you’ll recognize other patterns and key directories like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/</code>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdulqadir Ahmad</name></author><category term="linux" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first layed my hands on a unix computer, I was confused.

It was by accident. So, here is the jist:</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">before</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">insert</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">after</th>

      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"|"</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> character represents your cursor position. Notice how it is placed between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quotes</code> after the command.</p>

<h2 id="full-jist">Full Jist</h2>
<p>If you don’t know what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> does in vim, I’ll suggest trying out <a href="https://linux.how2shout.com/how-to-open-vimtutor-in-neovim-and-vim-commands/">vimtutor</a>. Very hepful!<br />
Now, let’s break down the above commad (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ci"</code>).</p>

<h3 id="synopsys">Synopsys</h3>

<p><strong>Normal mode</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;operator-pending-command\&gt;[&lt;inner/A\&gt;]&lt;motion|text-object\&gt;</code><br />
Breakdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>: operator-pending-command - These are commands that requires a motion or text object to operate on. They include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>: [optional] inner. You can use either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> for inner or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> to include delimiteres if any. For text objects, I think it is compulsory. It has a specific effect with motions (explained later).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code>: text-object - This is a text object. i.e. The quotes and everything within it. Other text objects include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{</code> and `’.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code>: motion - Any motion. e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>These are normal mode commands. Just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ESC&gt;</code> from which ever mode you are to go back to normal mode and execute the commands.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Operator-pending</code> commands are commands that needs more information before it can execute it’s action. e.g. When you want to delete a text in vim, the command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code>. But how will vim know what you want to delete? Tell it! You have a lot of options. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">motions</code> to delete “motionwise”. i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dw</code> to delete word, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d$</code> to delete to the end of the line. Another option is to specify a text-object.<br />
Now, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text-objects</code> is a fancy word for group of text . It could be a sentence (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>), a paragraph (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p</code>),  or method (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]m</code>). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code> in the above example represents text withing quotes.<br />
What about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inner (i)|A (a)</code> part? Normally, when you specify a motion, it starts from the position of your cursor. But with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i (inner)</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a (A)</code>, you can perform the action on the whole … motion / text-object. i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iw</code> means inner word, excluding spaces around. It works for both text-objects and motions. Let me show you the difference.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">before</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">insert</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">after</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"hello |world</code>”</td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ds</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello |</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello | world</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dis</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, the action is executed starting from your cursor position. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, context is included.</p>

<h3 id="step-by-step-guide">Step by step guide</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open vim: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim file.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>Go to insert mode: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>.</li>
  <li>Type some text: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Hello Vim World!"</code>.</li>
  <li>Go back to normal mode: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;ESC\&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Execute command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ci"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>I like examples. So, let me give you some:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ci"</code>: Change text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code>side quotes.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yis</code>: Yank / copy whole sentence.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">di(</code>: Delete everything inside the parentheses.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diw</code>: delete the entire word.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=i}</code>: Format everything between braces (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saa"(</code> Using sandwich plugin, wrap the things inside the quotes with parentheses.  i.e. “hello world” =&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saa")</code> =&gt; (“hello world”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="over-here">Over Here</h4>
<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> also. e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d/</code>. When you timepress <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, it will open the search area for you to type something to search. When you click enter, it will perform the action  from your current cursor position to the first result of your search. This one was unexpected for me. I knew about using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> but not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>. Wonders of vim 😀</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, if you don’t practice / try these commands, you will forget it all. But if you keep practising, it will become second nature!<br />

I use it for man pages, diffs and git logs. The only disadvantage of it so far is that you can’t open it unless standard input (stdin) reaches End-Of-File (EOF). This happens when you’re reading from a program that might take a while before it finishes writing it’s output. I hardly even encounter that. According to the project’s README, “large files are slowing down neovim on startup”. What about it’s advantages? Well … I get to use neovim as my pager. All the cool stuffs about neovim.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neovim</code> version 0.9 or later, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> (Most probably installed) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scdoc</code> for man page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Neovim: The neovim wiki has a page on installing neovim for all platforms. I prefer the App Image one. Link: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim</li>
  <li>Bash: If you are using Linux, MacOS or WSL, you already have bash installed. I haven’t tried installing nvim pager on windows.</li>
  <li>Scdoc: It is available on most package managers. Read <a href="https://command-not-found.com/scdoc">this</a> for more info.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, lets install nvimpager!</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Create a directory to store the repo.</span>
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/repos
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/repos <span class="c"># Switching to the created directory</span>
<span class="c"># clone nvim pager's repo</span>
git clone https://github.com/lucc/nvimpager
<span class="nb">cd </span>nvimpager <span class="c"># Go to nvim pager</span>
make <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will install nvim pager to the default location on your system. To change the location, set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PREFIX</code> variable to the  location. e.g. To install nvimpager to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local</code>, run:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make <span class="nv">PREFIX</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.local
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvimpager file</code> to view a file in nvim pager or pipe a command to nvim pager: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command --help | nvimpager</code>. I have aliased nvimpager to np.<br />
Nvimpager has three mode:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pager mode: In this mode, the input is opened in neovim with read only mode. You can use all normal neovim commands that doesn’t edit the buffer. To set pager mode, pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> option to nvim pager.</li>
  <li>Cat mode: In this mode, all the input is written to your terminal’s standard output (stdout). It will still have syntax highlighting To set cat mode, pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code> to nvim pager.</li>
  <li>Auto mode: This is the default. If the text can fit in your terminal, nvimpager uses cat mode. Otherwise, it uses pager mode.<br />
To pass neovim options to nvim pager, specify it after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> option. i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvimpager -- -u ~/nvim/init.lua</code>. On this note, nvimpager’s configu files is different from that of neovim. That of nvimpager lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/nvimpager</code>. My nvimpager is focused on having very little startup time.<br />
Lastly, to use nvimpager as your default pager, you have to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MANPAGER</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PAGER</code> environment variables to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"nvimpager"</code>. And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config core.pager "nvimpager"</code> for git.
