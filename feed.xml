I use it for man pages, diffs and git logs. The only disadvantage of it so far is that you can’t open it unless standard input (stdin) reaches End-Of-File (EOF). This happens when you’re reading from a program that might take a while before it finishes writing it’s output. I hardly even encounter that. According to the project’s README, “large files are slowing down neovim on startup”. What about it’s advantages? Well … I get to use neovim as my pager. All the cool stuffs about neovim.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neovim</code> version 0.9 or later, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> (Most probably installed) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scdoc</code> for man page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Neovim: The neovim wiki has a page on installing neovim for all platforms. I prefer the App Image one. Link: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim</li>
  <li>Bash: If you are using Linux, MacOS or WSL, you already have bash installed. I haven’t tried installing nvim pager on windows.</li>
  <li>Scdoc: It is available on most package managers. Read <a href="https://command-not-found.com/scdoc">this</a> for more info.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, lets install nvimpager!</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Create a directory to store the repo.</span>
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/repos
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/repos <span class="c"># Switching to the created directory</span>
<span class="c"># clone nvim pager's repo</span>
git clone https://github.com/lucc/nvimpager
<span class="nb">cd </span>nvimpager <span class="c"># Go to nvim pager</span>
make <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will install nvim pager to the default location on your system. To change the location, set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PREFIX</code> variable to the  location. e.g. To install nvimpager to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local</code>, run:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make <span class="nv">PREFIX</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.local
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvimpager file</code> to view a file in nvim pager or pipe a command to nvim pager: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command --help | nvimpager</code>. I have aliased nvimpager to np.<br />
Nvimpager has three mode:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pager mode: In this mode, the input is opened in neovim with read only mode. You can use all normal neovim commands that doesn’t edit the buffer. To set pager mode, pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> option to nvim pager.</li>
  <li>Cat mode: In this mode, all the input is written to your terminal’s standard output (stdout). It will still have syntax highlighting To set cat mode, pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code> to nvim pager.</li>
  <li>Auto mode: This is the default. If the text can fit in your terminal, nvimpager uses cat mode. Otherwise, it uses pager mode.<br />
To pass neovim options to nvim pager, specify it after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> option. i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvimpager -- -u ~/nvim/init.lua</code>. On this note, nvimpager’s configu files is different from that of neovim. That of nvimpager lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/nvimpager</code>. My nvimpager is focused on having very little startup time.<br />
Lastly, to use nvimpager as your default pager, you have to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MANPAGER</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PAGER</code> environment variables to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"nvimpager"</code>. And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config core.pager "nvimpager"</code> for git.

<em>Memoization is a use case for caching, i.e., memoization is caching when the cached thing is the result of a function call; in that case, the function being cached has to be designed to maintain the cache. And if the function is not natively able to memoize, it’s easy - you decorate it!

<em>And after that, you can even mock it. Yes, that’s right - pretend to be the function when you are a pure fake! And it’s easy to do that too - just import Mock from unittest.mock and create a mock object and make it fake to return anything you wish! Or, if you are enjoying the pun, try MagicMock. Same stuff, with more Python magic sprinkled on it.😀</em><br />
<em>And oh, I almost forgot: while you’re at it, there is more fun - you can make multiple tests more cool - just parameterize it. That is, use one test with parameters to do several others at once, like killing several birds with one stone.</em><br />
<em>See? It’s easy when you think about it!</em><br />
<em>No cache😀</em><br />
